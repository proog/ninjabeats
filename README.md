NinjaBeats is a side-scrolling platformer with levels generated by randomness or a music track.

The game is the result of a 3 week project in a software architecture course at the IT University of Copenhagen. It was developed in 2013 by Jacob Rasmussen, Jesper BÃ¸g and me. I'm posting it here for posterity.

## Objective

The goal of the game is to obtain as many points as possible before reaching the end of the level. You control a small, constantly running ninja that must jump between floor and ceiling platforms to not die and receive minus points. Enemies are flying all around you, leaving coins when taking a few shurikens to the face.

The game can be played in either randomly generated or music based mode.

## Controls

- Space: Jump between floor and ceiling
- Mouse: Aim the crosshairs
- Left mouse button: Throw a shuriken
- Left click on buttons to navigate the menus
